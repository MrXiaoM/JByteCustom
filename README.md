# JByteCustom
A fork of JByteMod-Reborn, with more updates. USES KOFFEE DECOMPILER!
<br>
***IF YOU WANT A VERSION WITH A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE, USE GHOST UPDATES (versions with b in the end)***<br>
***THOSE VERSIONS WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING RELATED TO PERFORMANCE.***<br>
***EXAMPLE:***
- Version 1.1.2 don't have class Methods support in their RPC.
- Version 1.1.2-b2 have class Methods support in their RPC.<br>
<ins>*Nothing related to performance changed. That's how ghost updates will work.*</ins><br>
*Note: ghost updates will NOT be added to releases. You will need to build yourself.*

## NOTES
- Koffee Disassembler (VERY USEFUL FOR BYTECODE UNDERSTANDING)
- Up-to-date Decompilers.
- Up-to-date Libs
- Best settings by default
- Advanced Discord RPC

## Discord RPC
Added "Change RPC" Option to File tab in the menus.<br>
