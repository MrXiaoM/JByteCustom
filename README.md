# JByteCustom
A **sophisticated** fork of JByteMod-Reborn, with more updates. 

## Features
- Koffee Disassembler
- Up-to-date Decompilers.
- Up-to-date Libs
- Single .class files extractor / decompiler
- Discord RPC

## Building
1. Extract the .zip that you downloaded from github
2. Open the extracted folder
3. Open CMD (command prompt) on the folder (or linux terminal)
4. Do `gradlew build` (or `chmod +x gradlew` / `./gradlew build`)
5. After building, go to ../builds/libs and use the X-release.jar one.
6. Done!

## Extracting Classes
1. Select your class, then switch to `"Decompiler"` tab.
2. Click on the `"Extract"` button
3. Select the folder and the file name to save the decompiled class

**OBS:** The "Extract" Button only works if you have decompiled a class
