# JByteCustom
A **sofisticated** fork of JByteMod-Reborn, with more updates. 

## Features
- Koffee Disassembler
- Up-to-date Decompilers.
- Up-to-date Libs
- Discord RPC

## Building
1. Extract the .zip that you downloaded from github
2. Open the extracted folder
3. Open CMD (command prompt) on the folder (or linux terminal)
4. Do `gradlew build` (or `chmod +x gradlew` / `./gradlew build`)
5. After building, go to ../builds/libs and use the X-release.jar one.
6. Done!

## Discord RPC
How to use:
- After clicking on "Change RPC", a new Window will appear.
- Input your new custom state/details text. *leave empty if you want to reset!*<br>
- Press Apply button for apply the changes.

OBS: The "Extract" Button only works if you have decompiled a class!
OBS: Remember to put .java on the end of the file! (if you forget it, JByteCustom will do it for you!)
